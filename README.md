This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS where the order of styles does not dictate the final rendering due to CSS specificity.  Inline styles and ID selectors take precedence over class and element selectors regardless of declaration order. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` shows how to resolve this by ensuring the intended styles have higher specificity or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged).
