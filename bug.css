The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results if not carefully considered.  For example, inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by ID selectors, then class selectors, and finally element selectors.  If a more general rule is defined *after* a more specific rule, it won't override the specific rule, even if it seems like it should based on the order. This can be subtle and difficult to debug.
